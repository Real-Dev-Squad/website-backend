## Getting Started

Instructions for initial setup can be found in the [README](README.md).

## NPM Command Reference

##### `npm install`

Installs all `dependencies` listed in the root `package.json`.

##### `npm run test`

The script associated with `npm run test` will run all tests that ensures that your commit does not break anything in the
repository. This will run the lint, integration and unit tests.

##### `npm run lint`
Runs the lint checks in the project.

##### `npm run generate-api-schema`
Generates the API schema in the file `public/apiSchema.json`.

##### `npm run test-config`
Runs the test for checking local development setup is working properly or not.

## Generating Authentication Token
- Run the project locally, make sure the server is listening to requests
- Navigate to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=<GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>`
- Authorize the application
- Copy the response cookie named rds-session from the redirected request <HOST>/auth/github/callback?code=<SOME_AUTOGENERATED_CODE>
- Use the cookie for authenticated routes in the API.
- For non-production environments, authentication is also supported with the `Authorization` header.
- Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Testing Guidelines
- Libraries used in testing in the project:
  - [mocha](https://mochajs.org/): Test framework
  - [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): Assertion library
  - [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/): JavaScript test spies, stubs and mocks
  - [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock/blob/main/README.md): HTTP requests mocking
- The test suite uses [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) for running firestore for tests([documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure)).
- Pre-requisites:
  - Node.js version 8.0 or higher.
  - Java version 1.8 or higher.
  - Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`

## Using Firebase Emulator Locally
- [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) can be used locally as the DB for the project
- Pre-requisites:
  - Node.js version 8.0 or higher.
  - Java version 1.8 or higher.
  - Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Run: `firebase emulators:start`
- The emulator will be running on the port: 8080
- You can view the emulator UI at: `http://localhost:4000`

## Running test scripts on Windows
- Git Bash is recommended for running test scripts.
- Run `npm run test-integration` for running integration tests.
- Run `npm run test-unit` for running unit tests.
- Make sure to close the emulator window after running the tests in order to avoid the blocking of the port for the next tests to run. 
- For e.g - After running the integration tests, close the emulator window and then run the command for unit tests.

## Pull request guidelines
- Ensure that the tests pass locally before raising a PR.
- All pull requests should have base as the develop branch.
- Every pull request should have associated issue(s) on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/website-backend/issues).
- For any non-trivial fixes and features, unit and integration tests must be added. The PR reviewer should not approve/merge PR(s) that lack these.
- The PR(s) should be merged only after the CI passes.
