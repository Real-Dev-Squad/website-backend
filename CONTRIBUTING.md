## Getting Started

Instructions for initial setup can be found in the [README](README.md).

## Yarn Command Reference

##### `yarn`

Installs all `dependencies` listed in the root `package.json`.

##### `yarn run test`

The script associated with `yarn run test` will run all tests that ensures that your commit does not break anything in the
repository. This will run the lint, integration and unit tests.

##### `yarn run lint`

Runs the lint checks in the project.

##### `yarn run generate-api-schema`

Generates the API schema in the file `public/apiSchema.json`.

##### `yarn run validate-setup`

Runs the test for checking local development setup is working properly or not.

## Project Structure

The following project structure should be followed:

```shell script
|-- website-backend
    |-- config
    |   |-- custom-environment-variables.js
    |   |-- default.js
    |   |-- development.js
    |   |-- production.js
    |   |-- staging.js
    |   |-- test.js
    |-- controllers
    |   |-- health.js
    |   |-- // Controller files concerning function on a similar entity
    |-- logs
    |   |-- // log files
    |-- middlewares
    |   |-- // individual middleware files to be required on server start or in the route middleware
    |-- models
    |   |-- // Files consisting of the individual table/collection config and wrapper interaction functions
    |-- routes
    |   |-- index.js // routes files separated by their first path string
    |   |-- auth.js // the individual routes files should contain the OPEN API JSDOC reference
    |-- services
    |   |-- authService.js // Files using any 3rd party library/service or providing any secific service in the project

```

## Generating Authentication Token

- Run the project locally, make sure the server is listening to requests
- Navigate to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=<GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>`
- Authorize the application
- Once authorized, check browser's cookies section. Copy the value of the cookie named `rds-session` (`rds-session-development` for development mode).
- Use the cookie for authenticated routes in the API.
- For non-production environments, authentication is also supported with the `Authorization` header.
- Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Production login:
https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=23c78f66ab7964e5ef97

### Production login - Cookie:
rds-session

## Staging login:
https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=c4a84431feaf604e89d1

### Staging login - Cookie: 
rds-session-staging

## Testing Guidelines

- Libraries used in testing in the project:
  - [mocha](https://mochajs.org/): Test framework
  - [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): Assertion library
  - [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/): JavaScript test spies, stubs and mocks
  - [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock/blob/main/README.md): HTTP requests mocking
- The test suite uses [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) for running firestore for tests([documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure)).
- Pre-requisites:
  - Node.js version 8.0 or higher.
  - Java version 1.8 or higher.

## Using Firebase Emulator Locally

- [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) can be used locally as the DB for the project
- Pre-requisites:
  - Node.js version 8.0 or higher.
  - Java version 1.8 or higher.
- Run: `npx firebase emulators:start`
- The emulator will run and display the url you can access it on.
- You can view the emulator UI at: `http://localhost:4000`
- To run the application with using firebase emulator, run the following command([docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_firestore#admin_sdks)):

```shell
export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:<Firebase emulator PORT>"
```

## Running test scripts on Windows

- Git Bash is recommended for running test scripts on Windows.
- Run `yarn run test-integration` for running integration tests.
- Run `yarn run test-unit` for running unit tests.
- Make sure the server is not running.
- Make sure to close the emulator window after running the tests in order to avoid the blocking of the port for the next tests to run.
- For e.g - After running the integration tests, close the emulator window and then run the command for unit tests.

## Pull request guidelines

- Ensure that the tests pass locally before raising a PR.
- All pull requests should have base as the develop branch.
- Every pull request should have associated issue(s) on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/website-backend/issues).
- For any non-trivial fixes and features, unit and integration tests must be added. The PR reviewer should not approve/merge PR(s) that lack these.
- The PR(s) should be merged only after the CI passes.
