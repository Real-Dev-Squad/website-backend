## About the Project

This Project serves the backend APIs required for [Real Dev Squad](https://realdevsquad.com/) web projects. This project is built in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

## Prerequisites

- The application uses [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config)([documentation](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files)) for managing config.
- Create a new file: `config/local.js`. Override the required config values from `config/development.js` and `config/default.js` into `config/local.js`.
- Register the application for [GitHub OAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app) to get the `clientId` and `clientSecret`. Add the callback URL as `http://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/auth/github/callback`
- Create an application on [FireStore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and [generate a service file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys). Add the service file credentials in the local config (or your env variables) as a string. Make sure you convert all the escape sequence (newline) - `\n` with `\\n` in private_key field.
- For running the project locally, [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) can also be used instead of using the remote DB. Steps for setting it up: [CONTRIBUTING.md - Using Firebase Emulator Locally](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/website-backend/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-firebase-emulator-locally)

## Starting Local Development

Please install `yarn` and `volta`

[Why Volta?](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/#why-volta)

To install Volta, please follow the [process](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started)

### Local Development Setup

Install all the packages using the following command:

```shell
yarn
```
Now if one runs yarn install. The yarn.lock will be unexpectedly updated with an unknown future version of a dependency, potentially breaking the build in the future. To ensure that the yarn.lock file is not update, you will need to use the --frozen-lockfile flag.

```shell
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

#### Confirm correct configuration setup

This command should be successful, before moving to development.


```shell
yarn validate-setup
```

#### TDD Local Development

Head over to [TDD Tests Files List](scripts/tests/tdd-files-list.txt), and add the list of your new (or old) test files.

> You can use wildcard '\*' in the filepaths

Run TDD in watch mode. Exiting this command will print the coverage report. Try to achieve 100% coverage.

```shell
yarn tdd:watch
```

#### Running a server in Dev mode

```shell
yarn dev
```

## What happens in production:

- Install packages

```
yarn
```

- Run tests

```
yarn run test
```

- Prune dev dependencies

```
npm prune --production
```

- Run start command (with port information)

```
yarn start
```

Note: These are handled automatically behind the scene when pushing to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
