Together, it seems to \n        create the 'chaincode' that we need to enable hyperdrive and finish the mission.\n        \n        Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to use your coding skills, cunning mind, sharp logic and grit to help us get over the huddle.\n\n        You are our only hope.\n        All the best! Lightspeed ahead."
