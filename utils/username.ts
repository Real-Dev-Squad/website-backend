/**
 * Formats a username by sanitizing the first and last names (removing non-alphabetical characters),
 * ensuring that it fits within a 32-character limit, and appending a suffix to guarantee uniqueness.
 * If the last name contains two words, they are joined by a hyphen and counted towards the limit.
 * 
 * @param {string} firstName - The user's first name, which will be sanitized and truncated if necessary.
 * @param {string} lastName - The user's last name, which will be sanitized and potentially hyphenated if it contains two words.
 * @param {number} suffix - A unique numeric suffix appended to the username to ensure it is unique.
 * @returns {string} - The formatted username with the suffix, within the 32-character limit.
